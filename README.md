# React Auth Starter Code

## Instructions (don't forget to do ALL of this stuff)
- install all the files from package.json (most, if not all necessary modules are already located in package.json)
    1. `npm i`
    2. `npm update`
    
- Touch .env :
    1. `DATABASE_URL=<database URL>`
    2. `SECRET=<whatever>`
    
- Then:
    1. `npm run build`
    
- Then, in two seperate terminals, run: 
    1. `nodemon server.js`
    2. `npm start`
    
- confirm that auth is working, and procede to code your app!
